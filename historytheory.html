<h3><b>Microtonality: an introduction</b></h3>
<br>

The topic of microtonality is much too wide to cover fully within this introduction, however a comprehensive history and explanation can be found in Harry Partch’s Genesis of Music, also a source for the developers of Tune.js. 
For the scope of this format, it suffices to say that microtonality comprehends any tuning or temperaments system that goes beyond the 12 semitone division of an octave (equal temperament) that is overwhelmingly popular in Western music. Semitones are sub-unit divisions of one octave and constitute the building blocks of our equal tuning system. Further divisions, for example, include 19 sub-units or 31 sub-units. Such sub-units are thus called microtones, since they are smaller than the regular semitone. 
As it stands, most of our instruments are built and tuned in accordance to such 12-step division and are more apt to equal temperament music, although it is still possible in many cases to produce microtonal music to an extent. When composing digitally, the issue of limitations in physical devices that are complementary to digital composition is an obstacle to microtonal composition. Although many devices have been built, they are still not widespread and therefore sometimes inaccessible. 
To bypass this issue, a number of browser-based composition platforms have been developed, to enable composers everywhere to produce microtonal music with ease. Some are more intuitive than others, however they all possess overall similar qualities: preset and customizable tuning systems, customizable mapping, recording and playback options, possible export/import of files, and visualization of the tuning system. 

<h3><b>The issue of Microtonal browser Composition</b></h3>

Many before me have attempted to solve the issue of digital microtonal composing by producing their own browser-based solutions. 
One such solution is Sevish, created by Sean Archibald, a British artist known as Sevish, who combines electronic music and microtonality. He has developed Sevish for composers who wish to create their own tuning and compose with it, while also allowing export in various file formats to apply the tuning in composing softwares (Archibald, n.a.). 
Leimma and Apotome is Khyam Allami’s Phd project at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire and provides a vast number of options in order to create your own tuning from scratch or by selecting one from the pre-compiled list available. It allows you to import and export files in Scala format (.scl) and to map the pitches to your laptop keys. It will only work with full MIDI functionality in Chrome or Chromium based browsers. His work is an example of what this current Senior Project aims to achieve, although on a smaller scale. 
WebSynths Microtonal, by Mitch Wells, is a lovely platform where one could design from scratch their own digital synth by making use of the many customizable features and record audio in MIDI format by custom mapping each pitch into one of the laptop keyboard keys.
xen-calc was developed by Matthew Yacavone as a calculator and converter if one were to need to calculate and transpose microtonal scales between cents, just ratios, EDO steps, monzos, FJS notation, colour notation, and intervals in up-and-down notation.
